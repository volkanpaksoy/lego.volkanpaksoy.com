    </h2>
    <time>25 October 2020</time>
    <p>
      </p>
<p>In the last post, I published photos of my latest news which includes Robot Inventor (51515) and SPIKE Prime (45678). They are similar in the sense that they come with the same programmable brick.</p>

<h2 id="spike-prime-and-expansion-set">SPIKE Prime and Expansion Set</h2>
<p>I bought the expansion set because of this simple principle: In for a penny in for a pound! I had alerady spent too much money anyway so what’s another £110 between me and LEGO!</p>

<p>Anyway, it came with lots of pieces but only 1 sensor and 1 motor so probably wasn’t a great purchase after all.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020/10/25/first-tests/spike-prime-motors-and-sensors.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>When you unbox SPIKE Prime, you don’t get a instruction booklet. There’s only a link that you’re supposed to visit to get started: <a href="https://education.lego.com/en-gb/start" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LEGOEducation.com/start</a></p>

<p>This is a step by step guide that shows you how to install the required software which is an iPadOS in my case called LEGO Education SPIKE. The app runs you through a tutorial thats shows how to build a program and deploy to the hub.</p>

<p>Before that it asked me to update Hub OS though which requires connecting the hub to a computer. It requires a software download on the computer to carry out the first update as the first update cannot be done via Bluetooth apparently.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020/10/25/first-tests/hub-os-update-02.png" alt=""></p>

<p>After that I created a project and connected the motors and sensors and I was able to get some response and confirm they are working.</p>

<h2 id="robot-inventor">Robot Inventor</h2>
<p>Robot inventor set doesn’t come with paper instructions either.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020/10/25/first-tests/IMG_3658.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>It is a similar set to SPIKE Prime but comes with different motors and sensors.</p>

<p>In the booklet, it suggested you go to this address to check your device: <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/service/device-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LEGO.com/devicecheck</a> which contains links to download the app.</p>

<p>I downloaded both iPadOS and macOS versions from the corresponding App Stores.</p>

<p>Similar to SPIKE Prime, I connected the hub via USB and got this message:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020/10/25/first-tests/mindstorms-new-project.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I’ll try developing programs in Python later. Just to see everything is working fine I connected the motors and sensors:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020/10/25/first-tests/mindstorms-motors-and-sensors-connected.jpg" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I found Bluetooth connection is a bit slow but it seems to work fine after it’s connected.</p>

<p>Having the ability to program in Python is great. It’s in beta mode now but I will give it a go anyway.</p>

<p>Now that I was able to see them in action, I will start building the robots that can be built by Robot Inventor and take it from there…</p>
