  <p>This post is about a few ideas and observations since I started LEGO hobby.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>LEGO is so versatile that there is not a single recipe to get started. Here’s a list of what I observed people do with their LEGO hobbies:</p>

<h3 id="builder-path">Builder path</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Build official LEGO sets: LEGO has so many sets available it’s almost impossible to get all of them (It would cost a fortune too!)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/2020/09/24/basics/IMG_2463.jpeg" alt="LEGO Harley Davidson"></p>

<ul>
  <li>Build MOCs: Most fun path IMHO! Just use your own imagination, creativity and skills and build your own models.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="collector-path">Collector path</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Buy LEGO sets and other collectibles (promotional items, keyrings etc)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/2020/09/24/basics/IMG_3003.jpeg" alt="My LEGO keyring collection"></p>

<p><img src="/images/2020/09/24/basics/IMG_3248.jpeg" alt="My sealed LEGO sets"></p>

<h3 id="investor-path">Investor path</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Buy and sell LEGO sets.</li>
  <li>Buy and part out sets and sell the parts/minifigures on BrickLink or BrickOwl</li>
</ul>

<p>These paths are not mutually exclusive though. It’s very likely a collector might as well start selling some of the items for profit or to buy more LEGO.</p>

<p>My main goal with this hobby is to build my own MOCs and combine them with lights and electronics to add motion and bring more life to the models I build.</p>

<p>The easiest way to get started is to simply go to LEGO.com and buy some sets. Start small and cheap. Pick a theme that you are interested in (Star Wars, Marvel, DC, Ninjago, Minecraft etc) and pick a set you fancy. After you build it you’ll know if this hobby is for you or not. If not then it’s perfectly fine because you haven’t buried a lot of money. If yes, then you’re about to embark a long and fun journey!</p>

<h2 id="sourcing-the-materials">Sourcing the materials</h2>
<p>If you intend to create your own models it becomes tricky because you now have to buy individual bricks and pieces. There are a few ways of doing this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Buy some sets on clearance and part them out. “Parting out” means putting all the individual pieces in boxes/bins or whatever storage you’re using without building the actual set. It’s generally cheaper to supply the pieces this way.</li>
  <li>Buy bulk used LEGO: Possibly the cheapest way of obtaining parts. Some people are simply trying to get rid of their child’s old LEGO and don’t care about making a huge profit off of it. That’s where you come in! The biggest downside of bulk used LEGO is you almost always get a whole bunch of non-LEGO in the bulk. It can be some off-brand bricks, crayons, rocks, dirt, hair etc. So it’s a good idea to give them a wash before even touching them. eBay and Facebook marketplace are good places to buy bulk LEGO. Another downside is the amount of time you need to spend on sorting it.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/2020/09/24/basics/IMG_2842.jpeg" alt="About 10KG LEGO waiting to be sorted"></p>

<ul>
  <li>Buy individual parts directly from LEGO marketplaces such as <a href="https://www.BrickLink.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BrickLink</a> or <a href="https://www.BrickOwl.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BrickOwl</a>
</li>
  <li>Buy individual parts from LEGO Pick A Brick (In stores or online)</li>
  <li>Buy individual parts from LEGO Bricks and Pieces. It’s mostly meant to replace missing/broken pieces but can be used to order other pieces as well on the cheap side.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This post is just a few observations and opinions about how to get started and how to expand going forward. Hope it helps to give a broad overview for beginners like me.</p>
