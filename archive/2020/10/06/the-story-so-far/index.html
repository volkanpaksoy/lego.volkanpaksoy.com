  <hr>
  <time>06 October 2020</time>
  <p>I started Lego hobby some time before this blog. So before going further I wanted to publish a post just to document the sets I’ve built so far. Once I’m all caught up, I can move on with the new sets and mocs and such.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It all began with buying some Mindstorms sets back in 2007 but sadly I didn’t dedicate enough time to make something useful with those sets. That’s an issue I’m planning to address this time around.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Years after in 2014 I bought Mindstorms EV3. I built some robots with it but it wasn’t very satisfactory. Again will address that in the very near future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After a few tries with Revell’s plastic models I decided to give Lego a go. That was an epiphany for me. I had all this Lego for developing robots, all the electronics (LEDs, Arduinos, Raspberry Pis). Everything I can combine with Lego to create great models. So I paid a visit to Lego store in Leicester Square which is a fantastic place to visit:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/2020/10/06/backlog/lego-mosaic.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<ul>
  <li>Got my first set from the store: Creator Expert Harley-Davidson Fat Boy 10269</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/2020/10/06/backlog/IMG_2425.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<ul>
  <li>After that I started to order some smaller sets. Spending hundreds of pounds on Lego was inconceivable at that point. It’s funny how things changed in such a short period of time. Here are a few smaller sets I built and put on display after:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/2020/10/06/backlog/IMG_2753.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="/images/2020/10/06/backlog/IMG_3263.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="/images/2020/10/06/backlog/IMG_3264.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<ul>
  <li>At this point I realized that Lego sets almost never lose value which is why lots of people invest in Lego. Probably wasn’t great that I discovered this because I ended up with this:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/2020/10/06/backlog/IMG_3260.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>and this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020/10/06/backlog/IMG_3320.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<ul>
  <li>I’m also interested in building my own MOCs. So I bought whole bunch of bulk Lego on eBay. Sorted some and my inventory system looks like this:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/2020/10/06/backlog/IMG_3496.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<ul>
  <li>I like the look of the inventory but when I tried to find which sets I can build using this inventory the results for quite disappointing. So I bought even more bulk Lego and currently in the process of sorting it</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/2020/10/06/backlog/sorting.jpg" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So this is clearly an ongoing process and I have LOTS of Lego to sort. I ordered more containers. In the next post I will discuss all different types of storage I use.</p>

<p>Clearly this is a very exhausting and time-consuming chore but it needs to be done before I can get serious about it. Now that I’m all caught up in this blog on my Lego journey I will try and post regularly about what comes next.</p>
