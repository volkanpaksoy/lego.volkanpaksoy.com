  <hr>
  <time>20 October 2020</time>
  <p>After realizing I was going to need lots and lots of pieces to build something with even medium size I started to buy bulk LEGO lots on eBay. In hindsight I now realize I overdid it! I bought about 160KG bulk LEGO and it took me ages to sort them.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You need to have a system. There are so many different bits and pieces it’s easy to get distracted and waste time on some low-value sorting actions.</li>
  <li>Accept that even with a system it will take a LOOONG time!</li>
  <li>Make sure you have enough containers. I bought a whole bunch of Samla boxes from IKEA and they are extremely useful to me Also sorting trays help a lot for small parts.</li>
  <li>Go in rounds. Don’t expect to sort every single piece at one go.</li>
  <li>The smaller parts get the longer it takes to sort. So 80/20 rule is valid in this case as well. Initially you go very fast but you will still have to spend a lot more time when you get down to small items like minifigure hands, 1x1 plates, cheese slopes etc.</li>
  <li>Create broad categories for initial sorting and sub-sort later. It will be a lot easier to sort a big bucket of bricks, for example, among themselves later on.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sorting-process">Sorting Process</h2>
<p>After sorting 160KG bulk LEGO, I think I can formulate my (ideal) process as follows:</p>

<h3 id="round-1">Round #1</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Large items (Baseplates, train tracks, large plates and bricks)</li>
  <li>Minifigures</li>
  <li>Special / unique / vintage / fragile / valuable items</li>
  <li>Electric parts (Battery boxes, lights, sensors etc)</li>
  <li>Half / full builds</li>
  <li>Obvious Non-LEGO items</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="round-2">Round #2</h3>
<p>Separate the parts: Most bulk LEGO comes with lots of pieces attached to others. If I like a build and decide to keep it hoping that I will complete it in the future or just to identify the set, I keep it as is (as mentioned in round #1). Any other pieces attached together should be separated down to individual parts. In my experience it’s taking a long time just to separate these partial builds.</p>

<h3 id="round-3">Round #3</h3>
<p>Separate the parts in these main categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bricks</li>
  <li>Plates</li>
  <li>Wheels / tires</li>
  <li>Doors / windows</li>
  <li>Foliage</li>
  <li>Wedges</li>
  <li>Slopes</li>
  <li>Minifigures &amp; accessories</li>
  <li>Windshields</li>
  <li>Pins</li>
  <li>Plates with clips and hinges</li>
  <li>Technic</li>
  <li>Unknown / unidentified (Looks and feels like LEGO but obscure parts)</li>
  <li>Non-LEGO (You will find lots of off-brand bricks and lots of junk)</li>
</ul>

<p>I did have more buckets than these when I sorted but I guess if I started over I would have done one full round on only these items. These take the majority of the entire bulk anyway.</p>

<h3 id="round-4">Round #4</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use a Box4Blox and sort by size.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even though this gadget is not very accurate it does help. I suggest do one round on the largest size. This way you always deal with similar sized items. Then go to middle tier and the smallest one.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Here are some before pictures:</p>

<p>I know the after photos don’t look very impressive because I need to do some subsorting by element type as well and add to the inventory. But I’ll relax and do that over time. At least I was able to reclaim the space. It was getting quite depressing that my entire home was covered with bins and storage trays and I had no living space left.</p>
